# fastn-p2p

Type-safe P2P communication library for Rust.

## Overview

`fastn-p2p` provides high-level, type-safe APIs for building peer-to-peer applications in Rust. Built on solid cryptographic foundations with Ed25519 keys and clean abstractions for common P2P patterns.

## Status

ðŸš§ **Under Development** - This library is being actively developed. APIs may change.

## Roadmap

1. **Phase 1** (Current): Core identity and key management
2. **Phase 2**: P2P communication patterns  
3. **Phase 3**: High-level application APIs
4. **Phase 4**: Example applications and documentation
