//! File Transfer Example
//! 
//! Demonstrates transferring large files efficiently over P2P.
//! Shows streaming patterns for handling large data.
//! 
//! This showcases how to handle large payloads that don't fit in memory.
//! 
//! Usage: 
//!   file_transfer server [key]                    # Start file server
//!   file_transfer client <id52> <file_path>       # Download file

// TODO: Implement file transfer example
// - Stream large files without loading into memory
// - Progress reporting during transfer
// - Chunk-based transfer with resumption
// - Shows fastn_p2p streaming capabilities
